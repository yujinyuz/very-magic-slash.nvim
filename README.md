## Usage

* Press `/` in normal mode and it will automatically become `/\v`
* Try `:%s/` and it becomes `%s/\v`
* Also works with `:g` and `g!`.

## Why?

This plugin may not be for you if you are comfortable with vim's current behavior when searching.

You can have a very basic implementation of this plugin by copying the lines below which was
extracted from my [config](https://github.com/yujinyuz/dotfiles/commit/ea086a):

```lua
-- Automatically add vim magic to search and substitute
-- See: https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Simplifying_regular_expressions_using_magic_and_no-magic
vim.keymap.set({ 'n', 'v' }, '/', '/\\v', { noremap = true })
vim.keymap.set({ 'n', 'v' }, '?', '?\\v', { noremap = true })

vim.keymap.set('c', '/', function()
  -- Get the previous command-line text
  local line = vim.fn.getcmdline()
  -- Check if the previous text is "%s"
  if line == '%s' or line == "'<,'>s" then
    return '/\\v'
  end

  return '/'
end, { noremap = true, expr = true })

vim.keymap.set('c', '?', function()
  -- Get the previous command-line text
  local line = vim.fn.getcmdline()
  -- Check if the previous text is "%s"
  if line == '%s' or line == "'<,'>s" then
    return '?\\v'
  end
  return '?'
end, { noremap = true, expr = true })
```

That worked for my basic use case, not until I learned more about the `:h global` command and that
I also wanted to apply very magic to it as well. But then it had an inverse equivalent which is
`:h vglobal`

The basic version also does not work with complicated ranges such as `:.,$` which means _from the
current line up until the end of file_.

That made my config quite complicated so I extracted it into this plugin.
